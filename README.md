Good morning everyone, Iâ€™m @Ouyuegu.
I am a musician living and working (not as a musician) in Shanghai. My wife and I are an audio/visusl band called COOLFASHIONMUSIC. and we play shows periodically around China. My wife plays the visuals and I play the music. It's basically dark, sardonic electronic pop songs with Tidal, vocals, some sound-making objects and a musical saw.
My main instrument is TidalCycles, which is what brings me here. I am an absolute rookie in coding matters, but love Tidal as a tool so much that I have been forced to try and understand more and more about Haskell, purely in order to troubleshoot my Tidal system.
